# Simple Kepler Orbits

## First usage guide
* Create new object, which will be attractor.
* Create other object, which will be orbiting body.
* Create create third object, which will be velocity handle helper object.
* Attach KeplerOrbitMover component to orbiting body object.
* Assign attractor object to AttractorObject field inside KeplerOrbitMover component.
* Assign velocity helper object to VelocityHandler field inside KeplerOrbitMover
* Attach KeplerOrbitLineDisplay component to orbiting body object to be able to see orbit curve.
* Move orbiting body and velocity helper in scene window and notice how orbit curve changes
* If you hit play, body will start moving along orbit curve around attractor body.
